# Bird-Species-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning

# Introduction
In this project, we will create a convolutional neural network which will be able to predict species of a bird. 
We will use different layers and other hyper parameters for building, training and testing our model. This is a multi-class classification model, will be solved using keras.
